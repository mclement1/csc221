#CSC 221 Final Project Proposal

In chemistry, the basic unit used for measuring matter is the mole,
a quantity equal to 6.022 x 10¬23 items. Chemical reactions, arguably
the central focus of such important areas as organic synthesis, polymer
science, and biochemistry, depend heavily on the molar relationship among
the various reactants and products, making the ability to measure matter in
moles of the utmost importance. Although a mole of atoms or molecules
cannot be measured directly in the same way that a milliliter of a liquid
can, it is a simple matter to relate the molar mass of one atom or molecule
(in unified atomic mass units, symbolized u) to the mass (in grams) of one
mole of that atom or molecule. To see why this is so, consider the carbon
atom, whose atomic mass has been defined as 12.00 u. One u is equal to
1.660539 x 10-27 kg, which implies that one mole of carbon atoms has a mass
of 1.19997 x 10-2 kg or 11.9997 g. Rounding this value to four significant
figures (in accord with the precision of the calculation) yields a mass of
12.00 g for one mole of carbon atoms. In the same way, any atom’s atomic
mass, as given in u, has the same numerical value as the mass, in grams,
of one mole of that atom. Furthermore, the same principle can be applied to
molecules, adding together the masses of the individual atoms to find the
molecular mass in u. Although the process of converting between grams and
moles is a simple and straightforward process, it can quickly become
tedious for large systems or repeated calculations, and as is always the
case when arithmetic is performed, particularly with floating point
numbers, the probability of making a mistake is high. In order to reduce
error and streamline this important process, thus saving chemists precious
time and resources, I propose to create a computer program to convert
between grams and moles. This proposed program will be simple and
straightforward to execute. It will take input from the user concerning
the type and number of elements present in the molecule of interest,
from which information it will be able to calculate the molecular mass.
The program will check for the validity of the atomic symbols entered,
as well as ensure that the user has entered the same number of atomic
symbols as numerical values. It will ask the user if he would like to
convert to grams or to moles, and based on the user’s input, it will
prompt the user to enter the starting value, either in moles or in grams,
as is appropriate for the situation. Finally, the program will output the
desired quantity for the user, also asking him if he would like to perform
another calculation or exit the program.
